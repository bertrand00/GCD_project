There is also raw datas that are stored in Inertial Signals files, that contains the raw datas that were processed to give features data

## Data Frame names 

* data contains the reading of the raw values of features
* data_filtered contains the data where -mean() and -std() are present. I chose to exclude meanFreq values on purpose, because only mean was asked. Is also added the name of each features left in the dataset.

* data_labeled contains the data_filtered with activity names and subject ID added. 
* data_tidy contains the mean of features following each subject id on each activity name.
